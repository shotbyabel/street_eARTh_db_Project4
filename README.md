# street_eARTh_db_Project4
Users will be contributors to the first ever database of art works found throughout the world's streets. The earth's walls are covered in art and they deserve documentation and this database will serve not only as reference but as a cultural tool.

I've traveled to 25 countries and I saw art being used to build up neighborhoods and to build pride amongs it's residents.
